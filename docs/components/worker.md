# Worker

The full worker is the mutation owner for scheduled leaderboard collection and
derived publication. Production runs it from the FSTService image as a separate
`fstworker` container.

## Hosted services

Full-worker mode registers:

- startup initialization and readiness;
- worker heartbeat/status;
- `ScraperWorker`;
- registration backfill when allowed by the run mode;
- band-rank-history background work.

API/frontend modes register only the background services appropriate to those
roles. Registration-sync mode omits scheduled scrape and band-history work.

## Continuous loop

After startup the worker:

1. resumes deferred publication;
2. ensures notification recovery is complete;
3. authenticates with Epic;
4. runs a scrape pass;
5. retries deferred publication/recovery;
6. exits in run-once mode or sleeps for `ScrapeInterval`.

Background registration and band work is paused and drained at scrape
boundaries so it cannot race publication-critical work.

## Two phase views

The pipeline has two useful abstractions:

- **Orchestration lifecycle:** authentication, exact catalog selection,
  leaderboard network/writer work, enrichment, registered-user refresh,
  rankings/rivals/statistics/precomputation, publication, and cleanup.
- **Selectable launch phases:** eight ordered solo flags and three band flags in
  `ScrapePhase`.

`ScrapePhaseResolver` expands `--solo-scrape`, `--solo-leaderboards`, and
`--band-scrape`, and fills intermediate solo phases. Selective flags affect the
first launch pass only; later scheduled cycles use the full pipeline.

## Publication safety

The worker freezes public reads before candidate work, requires an exact
catalog token, skips full-data derived phases after an incomplete scrape,
validates publication-critical outcomes, prepares the generation, drains
readers, commits atomically, and notifies clients only afterward.

Role defaults intentionally differ:

- worker writes candidate/published sources and enforces completeness/writer/
  critical-phase gates;
- service resolves public reads through published sources;
- publication read-context rollout remains disabled until every bound surface
  is generation-addressable.
