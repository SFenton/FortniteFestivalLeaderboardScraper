# Worker

The full worker is the mutation owner for scheduled leaderboard collection and
derived publication. Production runs it from the FSTService image as a separate
`fstworker` container.

## Hosted services

Full-worker mode registers:

- startup initialization and readiness;
- worker heartbeat/status;
- `ScraperWorker`;
- registration backfill when allowed by the run mode;
- band-rank-history background work.

API/frontend modes register only the background services appropriate to those
roles. Registration-sync mode omits scheduled scrape and band-history work.

## Production startup

The production startup contract has the boot orchestrator start the database,
API/web roles, and effective proxies without starting `fstworker`. Docker can
otherwise leave a worker Created forever when a `service_healthy` dependency
misses boot; its restart policy does not apply to a container that never
started.

Repository Compose templates put `fstworker` in the `worker` profile, so bare
Compose startup cannot include it. The continuous policy is
`restart: on-failure:5`: Docker may retry a nonzero process exit up to five
times while the daemon remains running, but daemon/host restart does not start
the worker. The guarded host startup path owns that transition. Run-once
merges retain `restart: no`.

The host then runs `tools/fst-worker-compose-guard.sh --recover-start`. That
action validates the continuous baseline and exact effective arrays, refuses
active/frozen work, requires the worker profile and restart policy, performs
bounded effective-proxy recovery and qualification, and recreates only
`fstworker` with `--no-deps`. The guard explicitly supplies `--profile worker`
both when resolving merged config and when targeting the worker start. Success
additionally requires a healthy worker container and a new fresh heartbeat
through `/api/service-info`.

The in-worker Gluetun recycler remains responsible for tunnel failures after
startup; it is not the boot healer. Recovery failure keeps or returns the
worker to a stopped state only if work remains idle and public reads remain
unfrozen. Once work or a freeze begins, the guard leaves the worker running and
directs the operator to the no-progress watchdog instead of risking a stranded
candidate. PostgreSQL, API, and web roles are never restarted. Candidate
profiles are run-once-only and are not continuous startup authorization.

## Continuous loop

After startup the worker:

1. resumes deferred publication;
2. ensures notification recovery is complete;
3. authenticates with Epic;
4. runs a scrape pass;
5. retries deferred publication/recovery;
6. exits in run-once mode or sleeps for `ScrapeInterval`.

Background registration and band work is paused and drained at scrape
boundaries so it cannot race publication-critical work.

## Two phase views

The pipeline has two useful abstractions:

- **Orchestration lifecycle:** authentication, exact catalog selection,
  leaderboard network/writer work, enrichment, registered-user refresh,
  rankings/rivals/statistics/precomputation, publication, and cleanup.
- **Selectable launch phases:** eight ordered solo flags and three band flags in
  `ScrapePhase`.

`ScrapePhaseResolver` expands `--solo-scrape`, `--solo-leaderboards`, and
`--band-scrape`, and fills intermediate solo phases. Selective flags affect the
first launch pass only; later scheduled cycles use the full pipeline.

## Post-scrape timing

Terminal phase names and publication criticality remain recorded through
`scrape_phase_outcomes`.

Band maintenance additionally records three stable timing subphases under the
`BandMaintenance` phase:

- `prune`;
- `search_projection_refresh`;
- `current_projection_refresh`.

The timing rows reuse counts already returned by those operations: deleted
band/member rows and affected scopes for prune, inserted/deleted projection
rows and impacted teams for search, and inserted/deleted rows and refreshed
scopes for the current projection. They add no discovery query.

Timing persistence is best effort. A timing-write failure cannot replace a
phase exception or cancellation and cannot change candidate publication.
BandExtraction membership/configuration work is not part of these
BandMaintenance timings. Durable live progress, API fields, and Settings
changes remain future roadmap work.

## Publication safety

The worker freezes public reads before candidate work, requires an exact
catalog token, skips full-data derived phases after an incomplete scrape,
validates publication-critical outcomes, prepares the generation, drains
readers, commits atomically, and notifies clients only afterward.

Role defaults intentionally differ:

- worker writes candidate/published sources and enforces completeness/writer/
  critical-phase gates;
- service resolves public reads through published sources;
- publication read-context rollout remains disabled until every bound surface
  is generation-addressable.
