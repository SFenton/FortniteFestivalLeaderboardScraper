# Data and publication readiness

These are verified gaps, not automatic implementation approvals.

| Item | Current evidence | Acceptance gate |
|---|---|---|
| Complete generation-addressable publication bindings | `EnablePublicationReadContext` remains false for both service and worker roles | Every publication-bound surface reports ready; stale/current generation behavior passes contract tests and live-safe validation |
| Finish snapshot/current-state ownership migration | Snapshot reuse is accepted and enabled. Scrape 1304 proved mixed legacy/generation writer routing and publication, but snapshot-overlay readers remain disabled. | Complete reader migration with replay/live parity, rollback, and storage/resource comparison |
| Bound physical snapshot generations | All nine instrument roots are generation-partitioned. Archive-only, quarantine/reattach, exact non-cascading DROP, logical restore, and H6 continuation/finalization are live-accepted. Candidate scrape `1345` and official scrape `1346` closed the DROP tier; cycle `33` then proved a 3.28 GiB Solo Guitar child through exact archive/network-none restore without source mutation. A separate default-off host control plane now persists bounded immutable policy and largest-first plan evidence only. Solo Bass `1308` remains excluded by unreplayed writer-failure evidence. | Merge and deploy the plan-only control plane, then collect read-only plan/reconcile evidence across distinct terminal cycles. Archive execution remains blocked on exact container binding, full-duration admission, and cooperative process/Docker cleanup. Permanent automatic deletion, multi-child execution, and sparse compaction remain disabled and separately gated |
| Evaluate bounded artifact analytics | DuckDB/Parquet is routed as an artifact-only option, not a production source of truth | Bounded export/replay benchmark that preserves PostgreSQL publication correctness and stays on the FST drive |
| Verify freeze-safe publication cache at a natural publication switch | Service-only promotion is complete. Scrape `1310` advanced publication `103`, preserved persisted reads through one deferred retry, and recorded zero HTTP failures across 309 monitor samples. The scrape evidence still did not attribute first-hit L1/L2 recovery or prove every invalidation-card observation. | At the next bounded cache-specific test, capture pre-publication leakage checks, atomic current/previous cache binding, L1 reset, first-hit L2 attribution, exact route parity, and public health without coupling that evidence to another data candidate |

Detailed post-scrape phase, progress, replay, deployment, A/B, and optimization
work is owned by the
[post-scrape processing roadmap](post-scrape-processing.md).

Completed physical cleanup, compaction, retirement, and rejected stored-rank
rollout documents were removed from the current tree and must not be
reintroduced as pending work.
